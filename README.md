# dotfiles

Dotfile collection! Including new computer setup, various rc files, and saved Sublime Text preferences/packages.

## New Computer Setup

From this folder, run (`./file.sh`) these files: 

1. `cli_installs` (runs `brew_installs_`)
2. `osx_defaults`

DISCLAIMER: Since updating these, I havne't run everything all at once, but last time I was setting stuff up, everyhing worked nicely and a lot of things haven't changed too much. It's probably fine.
